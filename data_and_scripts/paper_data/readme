Contains:1) Hongxiang's code and plots of Y(phi) error vs phi (theoretically gives the same results as X(phi)). Can easily be rerun
2)CX error experiment. Set qubit0 to 1, do repeated controlled X rotations with qubit0 as control.
3)Repeated X gate experiment with different 'families'. all fairly clearly labelled; the left-hand column in excel is the number of the specified gate in the circuit.
The files implement the following gates: results_x = u3(pi,0,pi); results_r360 = u3(2pi,-pi/2,pi/2); results_r180 = u3(pi,-pi/2,pi/2); results_x90 = u2(-pi/2,pi/2),results_y90 = u2(0,0)
