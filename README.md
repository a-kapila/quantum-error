# quantum-error
Summer Project exploring errors in NISQs and eventually trying to learn them via an RBM. Mostly using IBM's open access devices.

* **Project Summary** is the most important file here, documenting the evolution of the project.
* **data_and_scripts** contains all my code to produce exploratory data.
* **noise_circuits** contains circuits with artificial noise for testing purposes.
* **openpulse_tutorials** contains rough and ready notes from IBM researchers on advanced QIT/ Qiskit topics.
* **papers** contains papers I read during the course of the project.
* **sample_algorithms** were how I taught myself to code circuits in Qiskit.
